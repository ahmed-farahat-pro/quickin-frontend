// Guest disputes — filing one, and reading your own.
//
// Separate from db.ts because the /ops side of this lives only in the web
// project, and because disputes touch bookings, users and their own two tables;
// keeping the SQL together makes the lifecycle readable in one file.
//
// Deliberately NOT content-guarded. Every other free-text surface runs through
// contentguard, but a dispute is addressed to QuickIn staff rather than to the
// other party, and it routinely needs to quote contact details as EVIDENCE
// ("the host told me to pay him directly on 010…"). Guarding it would suppress
// exactly the thing an investigator needs. See README → Guest disputes.
