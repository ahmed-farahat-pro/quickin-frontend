// Unit tests for src/lib/local/ownership-doc-core.ts — what a host may attach to
// a listing as proof of ownership.
//
// Offline: no database, no network. Run with `npm test`.
// The explicit `.ts` extension is required — Node strips types but its ESM resolver
// needs the extension, and ownership-doc-core.ts has no relative imports, which is
// what makes it loadable here. See the README → Testing.
//
// The point of the module is that a deed arrives as a PDF at least as often as a
// photo, so the tests below pin BOTH halves: a real PDF is accepted, and a file
// merely calling itself one is not — the mime in a data URL is attacker-supplied
// text, the `%PDF-` magic number is not.
